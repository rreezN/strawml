# TODO
## Model Experiments
- [ ] Various pre-trained architectures (from TIMM & papers with code)
  - [ ] Vision transformer
  - [ ] CNN (ConvNeXt)
  - [ ] https://huggingface.co/spaces/timm/leaderboard
- [ ] Hyperparameter optimisation
- [ ] Data augmentation experiments
- [ ] Class amount experiments (5%, 10%)
- [ ] Regression vs Classification
- [ ] Include heatmap
- [ ] Include edges

## Model implementations
- [ ] Feature extraction from pretrained to use in continuous version
- [ ] Cross-validation
- [ ] More features ?
